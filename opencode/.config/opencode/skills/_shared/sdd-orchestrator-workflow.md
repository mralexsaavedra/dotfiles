## SDD Workflow (Spec-Driven Development)

SDD is the structured planning layer for substantial changes. This file is the lazy-loaded Claude Code workflow surface; read it before handling `/sdd-*`, SDD meta-commands, SDD/Judgment-Day phase delegation, or SDD continuation/routing.

### Artifact Store Policy

- `engram` — default when available; persistent memory across sessions.
- `openspec` — file-based artifacts; use only when the user explicitly requests it or a change already exists there.
- `hybrid` — both backends; useful for team-shareable files plus cross-session recovery.
- `none` — return results inline only; recommend enabling engram or openspec.

### Commands

Skills and slash commands:

- `/gentle-sdd-init` → initialize SDD context; detects stack and testing capabilities.
- `/gentle-sdd-explore <topic>` → investigate an idea; no implementation.
- `/gentle-sdd-status [change]` → read-only structured status.
- `/gentle-sdd-apply [change]` → implement pending tasks in batches.
- `/gentle-sdd-verify [change]` → validate implementation against specs/tasks.
- `/gentle-sdd-archive [change]` → close a completed change.
- `/gentle-sdd-onboard` → guided end-to-end walkthrough.

Meta-commands are handled by the orchestrator directly and do not appear in autocomplete:

- `/gentle-sdd-new <change>` → run exploration then proposal.
- `/gentle-sdd-continue [change]` → run the next dependency-ready phase.
- `/gentle-sdd-ff <name>` → fast-forward proposal → specs → design → tasks.

### Native SDD Dispatcher Guard

Before routing, continuing, applying, verifying, or archiving an SDD change, invoke the native dispatcher (`gentle-ai sdd-continue [change] --cwd <repo>` or `gentle-ai sdd-status [change] --cwd <repo> --json --instructions`). It resolves the artifact store the workspace declares and reports it in `artifactStore`.

- Do NOT determine the artifact store yourself, and do NOT branch on it. The dispatcher already did, and it returns the locators for the store it resolved.
- Use the dispatcher for every store and treat its JSON as authoritative over prompt inference.
- Route only by structured `nextRecommended`, dependency states, and `blockedReasons`; never infer from free text.
- If blocked, stop and report the blocker. Do not proceed to apply, archive, or terminal work.

<!-- Session preflight is projected here by the installer from the shared canonical authority. -->

<!-- gentle-ai:sdd-session-preflight -->
### SDD Session Preflight (HARD GATE)

Before every SDD command or natural-language SDD request, run this preflight before the SDD init guard; cache choices for the session.

Use the `AskUserQuestion` tool only when available and all three groups (Pace, Artifacts, and PR strategy) are exactly representable; otherwise use the lossless blocking fallback and STOP.
Ask Pace, Artifacts, and PR strategy in ONE `AskUserQuestion` tool call; no sequential wizard and no three separate calls.
Match labels and descriptions to the conversation language and persona; do not expose canonical/internal codes.

1. **Pace**: Interactive or Automatic.
2. **Artifacts**: OpenSpec, Engram, or Both (user-facing Both maps only to internal `hybrid`).
3. **PR strategy**: Ask me, Single PR, or Auto.

Review policy is fixed at 400 changed lines per PR; above 400, split the PR or require maintainer-approved `size:exception`; NEVER ask it as a fourth group or selectable budget.

Canonical mappings:
- Interactive -> `interactive`
- Automatic -> `auto`
- OpenSpec -> `openspec`
- Engram -> `engram`
- Both -> `hybrid`
- Ask me -> `ask-on-risk`
- Single PR -> `single-pr`
- Auto -> `auto-chain`
<!-- /gentle-ai:sdd-session-preflight -->
### SDD Entry Routing (MANDATORY)

For a new product/code change request that says to use SDD, start at preflight -> init guard -> explore/proposal (`/gentle-sdd-new` equivalent). Never launch `sdd-apply` just because the user asked to implement a feature.

Only launch `sdd-apply` when all are true:

1. Session preflight is complete.
2. The active change has existing spec, design, and tasks artifacts.
3. The user explicitly asked to apply/continue implementation, or the prior SDD planning phase completed and the orchestrator has passed the review workload guard.

If any dependency is missing, STOP and propose `/gentle-sdd-new` or `/gentle-sdd-ff`; do not implement.

### SDD Init Guard (MANDATORY)

Before executing any SDD command or meta-command, check whether `sdd-init` has run for this project:

1. Search Engram: `mem_search(query: "sdd-init/{project}", project: "{project}")`.
2. If found, proceed normally.
3. If not found, run `sdd-init` first, then continue with the requested command.

This ensures testing capabilities, Strict TDD mode, and project context are available to later phases.

### Execution Mode

This is collected by `SDD Session Preflight`. If missing, enforce the hard gate before any phase work. Cache the collected mode for the session:

- **Automatic** (`auto`): phases run back-to-back without pausing, but the orchestrator gatekeeper validates after each phase before launching the next.
- **Interactive** (`interactive`): after each phase, show a concise summary and ask whether to adjust or continue.

If the user doesn't specify, default to **Automatic**. After scope approval, expect zero further prompts on the happy path and at most one actionable prompt per recoverable failure; the gatekeeper summarizes phase progress instead of interrupting except on a second consecutive gate failure or a genuine scope/product decision. Interactive approval is phase-scoped; words like "continue", "dale", or "go on" approve only the immediate next phase.

### Research and Pre-Proposal Gate (MANDATORY) — Offer `sdd-research` immediately after `sdd-explore`; selection makes completion mandatory. Before every `propose`, invoke `sdd-propose` only when selected research is `done` or research is unselected, product decisions are `confirmed`, evidence references are valid, and the selected artifact-store state is ready. The orchestrator owns product discovery. Automatic unresolved choices require one lossless grouped prompt with all context, options, consequences, allowed answers, and exact tokens; it MUST persist the pending state before prompting, then STOP without invoking `sdd-propose`. The proposer receives a confirmed pre-proposal handoff and MUST NOT interview or infer consent. Native `gentle-ai.sdd-status/v2` is the sole status contract.

### Automatic Mode Gatekeeper (MANDATORY)

In Automatic mode, the orchestrator validates every delegated phase result before launching the next phase. The gatekeeper runs after every phase and before launching the next sub-agent.

Gate checks:

- **Contract conformance:** returned `status`, `executive_summary`, `artifacts`, `next_recommended`, `risks`, and `skill_resolution`; status is not partial/failed/blocked.
- **Artifact existence:** declared artifact is readable in the active backend.
- **No hallucination:** claimed files, symbols, commands, and artifacts exist.
- **No drift from inputs:** proposal/spec/design/tasks/apply outputs stay consistent with their dependencies.
- **Routing coherence:** `next_recommended` follows the dependency graph and no unaddressed CRITICAL risk remains.

Hybrid validation:

- Inline for low-risk phases: `sdd-explore`, `sdd-spec`, `sdd-tasks`, `sdd-archive`.
- Fresh-context phase-contract validator for `sdd-design` and `sdd-apply`: validate only the phase artifact against its inputs. This is not adversarial implementation review, inspects no code diff, and creates no 4R/Judgment-Day budget.
- Escalate to fresh-context review when an inline gate smells wrong.

On gate failure, re-run the same phase exactly once with specific corrective feedback. If the second result fails, STOP the automatic chain and report; do not advance dependent phases.

### Native Runtime Attempt Authority (MANDATORY)

Use the provider-owned Git-common-dir runtime ledger for every runtime-bearing `sdd-apply`, `sdd-verify`, or remediation continuation. It is the single attempt/budget authority for both OpenSpec and Engram; never persist caller-authored counters in OpenSpec files, Engram topics, prompts, or Pi state.

1. Before an actor or harness launch, call `gentle-ai sdd-attempt acquire --cwd <repo> --change <change> --request-id <id> --work-unit <label> --evidence-goal <goal> --max-attempts <count> --max-changed-lines <count>`.
   - Exception: when this launch is a phase actor started BY a parent that already ran this exact acquire and got `state: proceed`, do not acquire blind — pass the parent's returned token as `--token <token>` on the actor's own acquire call. A matching token proves the actor is continuing that SAME attempt and returns `proceed` with zero ledger mutation; acquiring without it collides with the parent's own active attempt and deadlocks on `blocked: active_attempt` (#2291).
2. Launch only when acquire returns `state: proceed`, and retain its opaque `token`. `blocked` or `complete` stops the launch.
3. After a failed or passed run, call `gentle-ai sdd-attempt settle --cwd <repo> --change <change> --token <token> --request-id <settle-id> --outcome <passed|failed> --evidence-revision <sha256> --diagnosis "<proven-diagnosis>" --harness-disposition <reused|invalidated> --cleanup-evidence "<evidence>" --process-evidence "<evidence>"`. After an interrupted run, pass `--outcome interrupted` and omit `--evidence-revision`. When the acquire carried `--remediates-evidence-revision <sha256>`, settle with the same `--remediates-evidence-revision <sha256>`. Use a `<settle-id>` distinct from the acquire operation's request ID; reuse each operation's own ID only for its idempotent replay. Settle defines no other flag and derives native binding and remediation inputs itself.
4. On any failed external command (test command or non-test external command) before a later native block, disclose in this order: **Primary failure:** identify the command in a privacy-safe form, its failed/cancelled/non-zero outcome, and only bounded relevant error evidence; never persist or print secrets, private values, raw environment, or unbounded output. **Verification consequence:** state that the current SDD phase/verification did not pass. **Attempt settlement:** when the native contract requires it, settle the current token with the correct failed/interrupted outcome and diagnosis, and disclose the settlement result before any later acquire/refusal. **Secondary governance block:** label a later objective-change/acquire refusal as secondary, never as the cause of the external command failure, and preserve the exact provider-owned runnable continuation unchanged. Never imply Gentle AI or the native ledger caused the independent consumer command failure.
5. Route only from settle's `proceed`, `blocked`, or `complete` state. Full `status|begin|finish|reset` operations are diagnostic/compatibility surfaces; reset requires an explicit maintainer scope decision and is never automatic.

### Artifact Store Mode

This is collected by `SDD Session Preflight`. If missing, enforce the hard gate before any phase work. Cache the collected store (`engram`, `openspec`, `hybrid`, or `none`) for the session. If unspecified, default to `engram` when Engram is available; otherwise use `none` and explain the persistence limitation.

Pass the artifact store mode to every SDD phase agent.

### Delivery Strategy

Use the delivery strategy cached by SDD Session Preflight; do not ask a separate strategy question:

- `ask-on-risk` — default; ask only when the tasks forecast detects review-budget risk.
- `auto-chain` — automatically split into chained/stacked PR slices when needed.
- `single-pr` — proceed as one PR only if the size is within budget.
- `exception-ok` — user accepts `size:exception` when over budget. The preflight menu cannot select this; it is reached only when the user explicitly accepts `size:exception`, either up front or when `ask-on-risk` stops to ask.

These four are the whole domain. Pass `delivery_strategy` to `sdd-tasks` and `sdd-apply`.

### Chain Strategy

When delivery planning yields chained PRs, ask once for chain strategy and cache it:

- `stacked-to-main` — each PR targets the previous PR branch or main in sequence.
- `feature-branch-chain` — PR #1 targets the tracker branch; child PRs target the immediate previous PR branch; only the tracker merges to main.

When chained PRs are selected, treat `chained-pr` (registry skill `gentle-ai-chained-pr`) as a required skill match. Resolve and forward it by registry path to `sdd-tasks` and `sdd-apply`; do not hardcode its path.

Pass it as `chain_strategy` to `sdd-tasks` and `sdd-apply` prompts alongside `delivery_strategy`.

### Dependency Graph

```text
proposal -> specs --> tasks -> apply -> verify -> archive
             ^
             |
           design
```

### Result Contract

Every SDD phase returns: `status`, `executive_summary`, `artifacts`, `next_recommended`, `risks`, and `skill_resolution`.

### Review Workload Guard (MANDATORY)

After `sdd-tasks` completes and before launching `sdd-apply`, inspect `Review Workload Forecast`.

If it says `Chained PRs recommended: Yes`, `400-line budget risk: High`, estimated changed lines exceed 400, or `Decision needed before apply: Yes`, apply cached `delivery_strategy`:

- `ask-on-risk`: stop and ask whether to split or proceed with `size:exception`.
- `auto-chain`: split automatically; ask for `chain_strategy` only if missing.
- `single-pr`: stop and require/record `size:exception` before apply.
- `exception-ok`: continue and tell `sdd-apply` this run uses `size:exception`.

Any other `delivery_strategy` value is invalid. Do NOT pick the nearest branch and do NOT proceed: STOP, report the unrecognised value, and re-collect the delivery strategy before launching `sdd-apply`.

Always pass the resolved `delivery_strategy`, `chain_strategy`, and PR boundary/exception to `sdd-apply`.

When launching `sdd-apply`, always include the resolved `delivery_strategy`, `chain_strategy`, and any chosen PR boundary/exception in the prompt.

### Sub-Agent Launch Deduplication (MANDATORY)

Maintain a session-scoped launch log of `(phase, task-fingerprint)` pairs. If the same pair already exists, do NOT launch again. Emit exactly one launch per distinct task and append the pair after launch.

### Sub-Agent Launch Protocol

ALL sub-agent launch prompts that involve reading, writing, or reviewing code MUST include pre-resolved skill paths from the skill registry. Follow `~/.claude/skills/_shared/skill-resolver.md`.

Resolve skills once per session, cache the registry, and pass exact `SKILL.md` paths. If a delegated result reports `skill_resolution` as `fallback-registry`, `fallback-path`, or `none`, re-read the registry before subsequent delegations.

**Key Learnings closing (generic delegations):** When delegating to generic agents (Explore, general-purpose), instruct the sub-agent to close its final message with a `## Key Learnings` section containing 1–5 numbered items, each a standalone factual sentence of ≥4 words and ≥20 characters. This enables engram passive capture of learnings across delegation boundaries. SDD phase agents load this requirement from `~/.claude/skills/_shared/sdd-phase-common.md` section F automatically.

### Context Protocol

Sub-agents start with fresh context. The orchestrator controls what context they receive.

For non-SDD delegation:

- Orchestrator searches Engram for relevant prior context and passes it in the prompt.
- Sub-agent saves significant discoveries, decisions, and bug fixes to Engram before returning.
- Orchestrator forwards exact skill paths.

For SDD phases, sub-agents read/write the active backend directly using artifact references, not copied artifact bodies.

| Phase         | Reads                                                  | Writes           |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------- |
| `sdd-explore` | nothing                                                | `explore`        |
| `sdd-propose` | exploration (optional)                                 | `proposal`       |
| `sdd-spec`    | proposal (required)                                    | `spec`           |
| `sdd-design`  | proposal (required)                                    | `design`         |
| `sdd-tasks`   | spec + design (required)                               | `tasks`          |
| `sdd-apply`   | tasks + spec + design + apply-progress if present      | `apply-progress` |
| `sdd-verify`  | spec + tasks + apply-progress                          | `verify-report`  |
| `sdd-archive` | all artifacts                                          | `archive-report` |

### Strict TDD Forwarding (MANDATORY)

When launching `sdd-apply` or `sdd-verify`, search for testing capabilities (`sdd-init/{project}`). If `strict_tdd: true`, add: `STRICT TDD MODE IS ACTIVE. Test runner: {test_command}. You MUST follow strict-tdd.md. Do NOT fall back to Standard Mode.`

### Apply-Progress Continuity (MANDATORY)

When launching `sdd-apply` after prior batches, search for `sdd/{change-name}/apply-progress`. If it exists, tell the sub-agent to read it first, merge new progress into it, and save the combined result. Do not overwrite.

### Archive Final-State Handoff (MANDATORY)

When launching `sdd-archive`, forward explicit final-state facts for any work completed after `apply-progress` or `verify-report` were persisted — verify warnings fixed in later commits, blockers resolved, tasks finished, updated test or issue counts — with commit or evidence references where available. Those two artifacts are intermediate snapshots, valid at the time they were written; the archive report records the state at close, and explicit final-state facts in the `sdd-archive` launch prompt outrank stale snapshot claims.

### Topic Keys

| Artifact        | Topic Key                          |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Project context | `sdd-init/{project}`               |
| Exploration     | `sdd/{change-name}/explore`        |
| Proposal        | `sdd/{change-name}/proposal`       |
| Spec            | `sdd/{change-name}/spec`           |
| Design          | `sdd/{change-name}/design`         |
| Tasks           | `sdd/{change-name}/tasks`          |
| Apply progress  | `sdd/{change-name}/apply-progress` |
| Verify report   | `sdd/{change-name}/verify-report`  |
| Archive report  | `sdd/{change-name}/archive-report` |
| DAG state       | `sdd/{change-name}/state`          |

Sub-agents retrieve full Engram content in two steps: `mem_search(query: "{topic_key}", project: "{project}")`, then `mem_get_observation(id)`.

### State and Conventions

Convention files live under the agent's global skills directory, including `engram-convention.md`, `persistence-contract.md`, and `openspec-convention.md`.

### Recovery

- `engram` → `mem_search(...)` → `mem_get_observation(...)`.
- `openspec` → read `openspec/changes/*/state.yaml` and artifacts.
- `none` → state is not persisted; explain the limitation.
